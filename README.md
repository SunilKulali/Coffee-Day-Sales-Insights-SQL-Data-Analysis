## Overview:
The project is designed to provide critical insights into the operations of a coffee chain business. By leveraging SQL queries, users can explore patterns in sales performance, understand customer behavior, and analyze city-wise and product-wise performance. The database includes sales records, product details, customer information, and city-specific metrics, making it a powerful tool for business intelligence.

## Key objectives of this analysis include:
* Tracking total sales and identifying best-selling products.<br>
* Understanding high-value customers and their purchasing patterns.<br>
* Analyzing city-wise sales and identifying top-performing locations.<br>
* Leveraging advanced SQL functions such as cumulative averages, product ranking, and customer segmentation for deeper insights.

## Project Features:
The project contains a collection of SQL queries that answer important business questions, ranging from basic to advanced analysis:

## Basic Queries:
1) Total Sales by Product: Display the total sales amount for each product.<br>
2) Top 3 Cities by Estimated Rent: Identify the top 3 cities with the highest estimated rent.<br>
3) High-Spending Customers: List customers who made purchases greater than ₹1000.<br>
4) Sales Count by Customer: Show the total number of sales and amount spent by each customer.<br>
5) Sales by City and Product: Calculate total, maximum, and average sales for each city and product.

## Advanced Queries:
